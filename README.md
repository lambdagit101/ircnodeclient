# ircnodeclient
Simple IRC Client made with Node.js and node-irc
---
## What is this?
This is a simple IRC client I made in a few minutes using node-irc and prompt
---
### How do I use this?
First, clone the repo into a folder or download the code and put it in a folder, then execute the following commands on the folder:
`npm install [irc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/irc)`
`npm install [prompt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prompt)`

### I am only able to access #assaultcube from server hostsailor.ro.quakenet.org with name Anonymous!
That means you did not modify the ircinfo.json file. That is the configuration file.
Modify it with your preferences. Then you can launch the client.
---
### Nothing's happening!
If nothing is happening, the server you specified might not work, the channel does not exist, or you have been blacklisted.
Other answer to this might be that some servers ban the usage of node IRC clients due to them being able to spam.

### I cannot answer PM's!
For now, you can't. This feature might come another day.
