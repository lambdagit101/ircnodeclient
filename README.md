# ircnodeclient

###### Simple IRC Client made with Node.js and node-irc
---
### What is this? ###
###### This is a simple IRC client I made in a few minutes using node-irc and prompt
---
### How do I use this? ###
###### First, clone the repo into a folder or download the code and put it in a folder, then execute the following commands on the folder:
###### `npm install irc`
###### `npm install prompt`
---
### Nothing's happening! ###
###### If nothing is happening, the server you specified might not work, the channel does not exist, or you have been blacklisted.
###### Other answer to this might be that some servers ban the usage of node IRC clients due to them being able to spam.
---
### I cannot answer PM's! ###
###### For now, you can't. This feature might come another day.
---
### I am not on the server and channel I want! ###
###### By default, ircinfo.json specifies the irc.freenode.net servers with the channel #freenode and the nickname Anonymous. You can change that in ircinfo.json.
---
### How do I customize the client more? ###
###### You can change the real name in ircinfo.json, altough, there is a 9-character limit.
###### You can also change the username to anything you want.
